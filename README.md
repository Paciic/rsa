<h1>rsa thing</h1> 
<h2>messing around with/ making the rsa encryption algorithm in Rust</h2>
<h3>currently there is: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>encryption</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>...thats it.</li>
</ul>

<h3> things to do: </h3>
<ul>
  <li>more efficent modulo function (1977 RSA Paper's algorithm at the least)</li>
  <li>decryption</li>
  <li>custom keys</li>
  <li>random coprime generator</li>
</ul>




<p>yes i know this is really badly coded (i hit some integer limit on my physical calculator and it gave me really weird results which made me spend an ungodly amount of time "debugging" before finding that part out)</p>
